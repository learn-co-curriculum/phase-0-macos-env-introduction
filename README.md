# Introduction to MacOS Environment Setup

In this module, we will walk through the process of setting up your MacOS local
development environment.

> **Note:** If you are not using a Mac computer for this course, skip the

## Brief History

### Understanding Environments

A **software environment** describes the set of tools that work together to
enable you to develop and execute the code that you write. Environments
typically include the operating system, databases, programming languages, and
related tools like text editors or browsers.

### Comparing Environments with Machines

You may hear us use the term "software environment" and "machine" to mean
similar things. A **machine** describes the physical hardware that your software
environment runs on. You'll hear the term machine and computer used
interchangeably. Different machines (like PCs and Macs) use different hardware
to run the programs that they use. Differences in those machines mean that
setting up your development environment on one type of machine could look much
different than setting it up on another.

### MacOS Operating System

**MacOS** is a UNIX-based operating system. UNIX-based operating systems are
very commonly used in professional software engineering settings. Learning how
to use a UNIX-based operating system will be valuable for your future software
engineering career. You may have heard of other UNIX-based operating systems
like Ubuntu, Debian, or Fedora, which include the Linux kernel (core software).
These types of operating systems work similarly.

### Terminals and Shells

You may be familiar with opening files and applications on your computer by
clicking icons, or viewing a website by typing an address into the address bar
and seeing what pops up. These **graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** created a
revolution in computing and are still extremely helpful in getting work done for
many non-technical computer users.

Before graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the way to tell the computer to do
something was through a **terminal**. The terminal included a screen, which
would display only text, and a keyboard. The screen and keyboard were connected
to a computer and you typed into the keyboard what you wanted the computer to do.
Then, you would press `<Enter>` and wait for the computer to finish.

Terminals are still used frequently today, especially in software development.
We can connect to another computer on the internet, give it instructions by
typing in commands, and view the result on our screen. The way that modern
computers emulate the terminals of yesterday is through a program called a
**command-line interface**, or a **shell**.

Similar to operating systems, there are many different types of shells. The
shell that Flatiron School supports on the MacOS operating system is called
**zsh**, short for Z Shell.

### MacOS Terminal

The "Terminal" application is a text-based way to browse and work with files on
your computer. We will be using the "Terminal" application during the
environment setup and the duration of the program. For now, let's start to see
what "Terminal" and more generally, **shell**s can do.

## View Your Desktop in "Finder" and "Terminal" Applications

To complete the environment setup, you will need to be able to open
applications. You can open new applications by using the "Spotlight Search"
magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of your window.

### Action Item: View Your Desktop in the "Finder"

The "Finder" application is a visual way to browse the files on your computer.
You may already be familiar with the "Finder" application. This application
allows you to quickly see the files on your desktop, downloads, documents,
pictures, music, videos, and much more.

1. Click on the "Spotlight Search" magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner
   of your window
2. Type "Finder" and open the application
3. Find and open the "Desktop" folder in your "Finder" application

### Action Item: View Your Desktop in the "Command Prompt" Shell

The "Terminal" application is the terminal that will allow us to interface with
our computer through a shell. This action item is to primarily get you
comfortable running commands in _any_ shell so that you can work through the
environment setup on your own.

1. Open the "Terminal" application using the "Spotlight Search"
2. Type `cd /Users` into the terminal and press `<Enter>`
3. Type `ls` (lowercase `L` and lowercase `S` together) into the terminal and
   press `<Enter>`
4. Look for your username in the list
5. Type `cd` into the terminal, add a space, and type your name as it appears in
   the list and press `<Enter>`
6. Type `ls` into the terminal and press `<Enter>`
7. Look for the "Desktop" folder in the list
8. Type `cd Desktop` into the terminal and press `<Enter>`
9. Type `ls` into the terminal and press `<Enter>` _(Note: if prompted, allow
   "Terminal" to access files in your Desktop folder.)_

### Check Your Work

If you were able to open your desktop in the "Finder" application and you were
able to open the "Terminal" application and `cd` to your desktop in that
application, you should see that you can see the same list of files in both the
**graphical user interface (GUI)** and in the **command-line interface (CLI)**
or shell.

This may be your first time using the "Terminal" application or any terminal or
shell. Now you know how to see the items on your desktop through the "Finder"
application _and_ through the "Terminal" application.

## Preparing for Your Environment Setup

- During the environment setup, you will be spending a lot of time in your
  "Terminal" application.
- As much as possible, copy and paste commands that we ask you to run there
  instead of typing by hand to prevent environment setup issues.
- Specific keys that you need to press will be surrounded by `<` `>` (for
  example, `<Shift>`, `<Space>`, `<Enter>`).
- You will need to be comfortable switching between windows; we will primarily
  be using the browser and the "Terminal" application.
- You should be able to start and stop the environment setup.
- If you get stuck, reach out to your classmates or an instructor.
